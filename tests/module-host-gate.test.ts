// THE MODULE-HOST PAGE IS PART OF THE PROJECTION, NOT AN EXCEPTION TO IT (cf#234 item 3).
//
// modules.html is the one studio surface whose entire job is to state what this host can do: it
// renders a stage per catalog hook and each installed module under the stage it serves. Every stage
// card app.js builds has declared `data-hook` since the page was written -- and the cf#98
// availability gate was never loaded on that page, so the declarations sat inert and a studio with
// no video-finish tier presented its dead stages as ordinary live ones.
//
// `notify` is the sharp end. It is deliberately skipped from the planner panel, it has no planner
// control at all, and the "enable notifications" toggle is NOT it (that is the browser Notification
// API, and gating it would grey out a feature that works -- guarded in hook-declarations.test.ts).
// So the stage projection is the ONLY surface in the studio where an unservable `notify` can be
// disclosed at all. If this file goes quiet, that disclosure has gone silent with it.
//
// These are asset guards over the SHIPPED files: they prove the wiring decision, not the rendering.
// The rendering is proven twice over -- against the real gate IIFE in hook-availability-gate.test.ts
// (a stage-card-shaped fixture), and in a browser against a real host payload before release.
//
// Every negative below is paired with a POSITIVE CONTROL, because an assertion over a file that has
// been renamed, moved, or emptied passes without proving anything.

// Vivijure studio -- the abuse-report link (control-plane#130). A GATE, not a feature, in the same
// family as readonly-gate.js and hook-availability.js: no nav entry, no page of its own, and a pure
// PROJECTION of the registry. The sole signal is host.abuse_report_url on GET /api/modules, the
// core describing itself, sibling of host.dispatch / host.readonly / host.hooks_unavailable.
//
// WHY IT IS A PROJECTION AND NOT A LINK IN THE MARKUP: this bundle is what a self-hoster installs.
// Our abuse address must never ship inside it, because we are not the provider for a self-hosted
// studio and cannot act on its content; a reporter sent to us about it would be sent to someone who
// can do nothing. So the address is operator config, the panel renders whatever it is handed, and a
// studio whose host reports nothing renders nothing. There is deliberately NO fallback address and
// no "am I hosted" branch: either would be the hardcoding the parity rule forbids.
//
// A hosted tenant gets the link. A self-hoster gets it too if they publish their own contact, which
// is the right answer rather than a special case for us.

// CONTENT-FREE-BY-CONSTRUCTION LOG LABELS (vivijure-cf#223 stage 1).
//
// PARITY COPY of vivijure-cf/src/log-scrub.ts, byte-identical below this header. The two panels do
// not share a runtime module (this one is Node, that one is a Worker), and the scrub is a PROMISE to
// the user, not an implementation detail -- a self-hoster reading their own logs gets exactly the
// same guarantee. Change one, change both, same window.
//
// The rule this module exists to make cheap: a studio log line may carry IDS, never NAMES. Project
// names, cast names, voice labels, prompts and raw R2 keys are user content, and a log line is the
// one place content leaks without anybody deciding it should -- it reaches whatever sink the deploy
// has (Workers observability, a self-hoster's own `wrangler tail`, a Loki shipper) with no
// per-field filter available at that layer. The filter therefore has to be at the CALL SITE.
//
// WHY A LABEL RATHER THAN OMISSION. A dropped field makes a log line honest and useless: "an
// artifact went missing" with no way to tell WHICH, or whether two lines are about the same object.
// A label keeps the line joinable (the same key always produces the same label) while carrying no
// content. That is the same trade the tenant-telemetry audit settled on for the control plane.
//
// WHY FNV-1a AND NOT SHA-256. These call sites are synchronous (console.warn inside a loop);
// WebCrypto digest is async, and making a log line async would push a `await` into paths that must
// not yield. This is a LABEL, not a security primitive: it is not a secret commitment, it is not
// reversible-resistant in any meaningful sense for a short input, and nothing may treat it as one.
// What it must be is stable, cheap, and dependency-free.

 * An R2 key as a log label: its top-level PREFIX, plus a stable id for everything after it.

 * The prefix is the only part of a key that is structural rather than user-derived (`bundles/`,
 * `renders/`, `cast/`, `out/` -- see the allow-list in index.ts), and keeping it is what makes a
 * line diagnosable at all: "an object under renders/ went missing" is actionable, "an object went
 * missing" is not. Everything after it can carry a project name (`bundles/<projectName>-<hash>
 * .tar.gz`, `renders/<project>/clips/...`), so it is replaced wholesale.

// Build the per-shot dialogue batch for the `dialogue` hook from the AUTHORITATIVE storyboard.

// The storyboard is persisted lossless in D1 (storyboard_projects.last_storyboard); the bundle's
// storyboard.yaml is a lossy GPU-render snapshot that drops dialogue. So at render submission we read
// the stored storyboard, pull each speaking shot's line, and resolve the speaker's voice from the
// slot -> voice_id map already produced by resolveCastLoras (one cast-row fetch, single-user, no new
// identity dependency). The line is authored content (from the storyboard); the voice is authoritative
// (from the cast). Result is threaded onto the FilmJob; the orchestrator submits it after clips.
